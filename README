The Chav's Prayer

Our father, who art in prison,
Mother knows not his name,
Thy Chavdom come, thy shoplifting be done, in JJB Sports as it is in Poundland,
Give us this day our welfare bread,
And forgive us our ASBOs, as we happy slap those who give evidence agaist us,
And lead us not into employment,
But deliver us free housing,
For thine is the Chavdom,
The Burberry and the Blackberry,
For ever and ever,
Init.
